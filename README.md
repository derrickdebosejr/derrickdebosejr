- During the height of the COVID pandemic, Spring 2020, I was in the process of graduating college. During that time, I was unable to find a job. Many companies were laying off employees rather than hiring entry-level and internship level positions. Although I was unable to find a position, I have not lost my dream. I will keep pushing until I can pursue my career of being a Software Engineer.
